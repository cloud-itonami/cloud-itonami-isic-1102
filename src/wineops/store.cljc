  "Store abstraction for wine-manufacturing production batches. Current
  implementation operates on plain data (`{:batches {batch-id batch-map}
  :facts [...]}`); production should migrate this seam to Datomic/
  kotoba-server (the same seam point all cloud-itonami actors use) while
  keeping the same pure-function surface.

  A production batch is the minimal unit of work: one fermentation/
  bottling run of a wine product, tracked from grape intake through
  crush, fermentation, pressing, aging, bottling, and shipment.
  Representative batch keys:
    - :product-type keyword product id (see `wineops.facts/product-types`)
    - :jurisdiction keyword jurisdiction id (see `wineops.facts/jurisdictions`)
    - :abv-percent / :residual-sugar-g-per-l / :volatile-acidity-g-per-l /
      :so2-ppm / :fill-volume-ml finished-product actuals
    - :vintage-year declared vintage year
    - :vintage-percent percentage of the finished wine sourced from
      grapes harvested in the declared vintage year
    - :fill-volume-variance-ml finished-product fill-volume drift from
      the product's standard-of-fill target
    - :contamination-detected? true if bottling-line inspection or a
      cork-taint/TCA/Brettanomyces spoilage-marker screen flagged a
      concern
    - :sanitation-score 0-100 winery/cellar hygiene score
    - :bottling-line-last-calibration-date epoch-ms of last fill-volume
      metering equipment calibration
    - :declared-allergens set of declared allergen/sulfite keywords
    - :evidence-checklist evidence items present for the batch
    - :safety-concern-raised? / :safety-concern-resolved? food-safety flag
    - :processed? true once a `:log-production-batch` proposal commits
    - :shipment-finalized? true once a `:coordinate-shipment` proposal commits

  The ledger (`:facts`) is a separate append-only vector of audit facts,
  kept alongside `:batches` in the same store value.")
